# Next.js Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Node.js version 20 or higher installed. LTS version 20.18.0 is recommended.
- Install `pnpm` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Installation

- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emranffl/potentialai
cd potentialai
```

- Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

- Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Building for Production & Starting the Server

- To build the application for production, run:

This will create an optimized production build in the `.next` directory.
